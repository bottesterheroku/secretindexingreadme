## Downloading (free)?
Yes! Completely free to download but you need to pass the link shortner which contains some ads. We have put that link shortner to get some donations for us which we'll be putting in hosting of the website i.e. Server Costs



## FAQs / Questions 

#### 1. Why don't you stream on website instead of providing downloading links?
Streaming on website requires much more money than putting downloading links and once we get enough donations to maintain website. We'll start streaming on the website with full power. Till then you have to download and watch or click on the button after the download link

#### 2. Where does your official community belong?
Our official community started from a channel in Telegram named [Anime Hub](https://t.me/An1me_Hub) in the early January of 2021 and at starting there was only one owner who handled the channel and did all the work and now we have a team (not much bigger but a combination of 4 professional guys) who handle the Telegram Channel and website work together and we are working our best to provide you the animes on time

#### 3. Can you please upload animes in lower size?
We are trying our best to compress the anime as lowest as possible without damaging the actual quality of the anime. If you want lower quality anime then you can reach as at our [discussion](https://t.me/AnimeDevils_Group) and tag [DarkPhew](https://t.me/DarkPhew) or [Sohail Khan](https://t.me/sohailkhan_indianime). No DMs or personal messages please because we don't have much time to talk to you cause we are also students like you are or you were.

#### 4. Will you ever make a community on Discord?
If you community gets large enough then we'll surely make a discord server and chat with you all there, till then you just have to wait for the day

#### 5. Can you please complete my request of the anime I want?
Sure, make a request in the website and we'll provide you the anime within 24 - 48 hours because we encode and compress the animes ourselves so it takes sometime.

#### 6. I also want to upload animes, what would you recommend?
Brace yourself, young padawan. If I give you some tip so you can download the anime from [NyaaSi](https://nyaa.si) and to learn encoding you can refer from here

#### 7. I have some more questions, where can I ask?
You can ask at [discussion](https://t.me/AnimeDevils_Group). [sigh] Literally it makes me sad to always redirect you to our discussion forum but we cannot do anything.
